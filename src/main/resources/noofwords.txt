Let me talk about Multithreading:
Multithreading,Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.




Threads can be created by using two mechanisms : 





Extending the Thread class 
Implementing the Runnable Interface
Thread creation by extending the Thread class
We create a class that extends the java.lang.Thread class. This class overrides the run() method available in the Thread class. A thread begins its life inside run() method. We create an object of our new class and call start() method to start the execution of a thread. Start() invokes the run() method on the Thread object.
